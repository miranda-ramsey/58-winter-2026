		<title>Course Description</title>
        <introduction>
			<p>
                Explores how to clearly communicate arguments supported by quantitative evidence. 
                Investigates contextual and open-ended mathematical problems. Develops mathematical 
                reasoning skills through interpreting information, making conjectures, communicating
                effectively, and verifying results. Emphasizes an understanding of the role of 
                mathematics and how it affects decision making in life. Uses collaborative learning
                through in-class group interaction. Uses technology throughout the course. Audit 
                available.

			<title>Learning Outcomes</title>
			<p>
                Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:
				<ol>
					<li>
                        Use and integrate several different types of technology to explore and 
                        analyze data to solve problems.
					</li>
					<li>
                        Use contextual information to reflect on and communicate the reasonableness 
                        of mathematical approaches and solutions.
					</li>
                    <li>
                        Use quantitative reasoning, articulate individual positions, and 
                        respectfully consider the approaches and solutions of others to contribute 
                        to the academic conversation.
					</li>
                    <li>
                        Critically analyze information for its accuracy, relevance, and credibility 
                        to reflect on how mathematics can be used in one’s life and in the larger 
                        community.
					</li>
                    <li>
                        Engage with and formulate questions to explore mathematical topics,
                        collaborate with others, and persevere through the problem solving process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Develop self-awareness of the learning process and self-monitor 
                        understanding and performance.
                    </li>
