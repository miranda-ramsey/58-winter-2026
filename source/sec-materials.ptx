		<p>
            We will be using the textbook Pathways to Math Literacy, 3rd edition. This book comes
            with an ALEKS code that you will need to complete homework in the class. <alert>It is
            very important that you begin the class with a fresh copy of the textbook and an ALEKS
            access code.</alert> If this is your second time taking the class, let me know so we
            can figure out what you can use again, and what you need to purchase.
