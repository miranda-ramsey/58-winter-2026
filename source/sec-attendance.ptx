		<p>
            During the first week of the term, instructors must record students who are not in
            attendance or engaging in the class. Students who have not done the following will be 
            dropped according to PCC's <url href="https://catalog.pcc.edu/handbook/g302-gradingguidelines-attendanceparticipationandnoshows/">No Show Policy</url>:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Attend all of the first days of class up to the drop deadline.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Enroll in the ALEKS course and complete the first week's assignments.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Initialize your Google Sheets spreadsheet assignment using the template
                        in D2L.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            If you are unable to complete one of these requirements but want to remain enrolled in 
            the class, you must speak to me to make an alternative arrangement to show engagement in
            the course.
