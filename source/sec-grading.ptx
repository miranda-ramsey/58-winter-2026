                    <title>Class Participation</title>
                    <p>
                        Each day of class you will receive a grade based on arriving on time, 
                        having all of your required course materials and notes completed, engaging 
                        and participating during the lab time, and staying until the end of class.

                    <title>ALEKS Homework</title>
                    <p>
                        Most sections we cover in class will have an associated homework assignment
                        in ALEKS. Additionally, there will be a knowledge check and a Module 1 check
                        assigned.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Discussions</title>
                    <p>
                        Each non-exam week will have a discussion prompt to respond to in D2L. 
                        Discussion prompts will be in two parts: 
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Create a new thread with your response to the prompt. Each 
                                    prompt will have instructions for that week's post.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    One or more replies to other students' posts. Each prompt will
                                    have instructions for that week's replies.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Book Applications</title>
                    <p>
                        We will be completing worksheets in the textbook as a class, in groups, and
                        on your own. There will be some time in class for this, but you will be 
                        expected to spend time out of class completing them if needed. 
                        Before each exam, I will collect your textbooks to grade your completeness. 
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <title>Spreadsheet Assignments</title>
                    <p>
                        As we progress through the class you will be assigned activities to complete
                        with Google Sheets. There will be some time in class for this, but you will
                        be expected to spend time out of class completing them if needed. I will
                        grade your spreadsheet for completeness twice during the term.

                    <title>Quizzes</title>
                    <p>
                        Each non-exam week will have a quiz on the material we covered in class.

                    <title>Exams</title>
                    <p>
                        There will be three exams, each covering a different module from the
                        textbook. The exams will be on February 4, February 25, and March 18.

                    <title>Final Project</title>
                    <p>
                        Starting in week 7, you will work with a group on a final project, planning
                        out the purchase of a car. Your results will be presented on the last 
                        scheduled class day before the final exam.
                    </p>

        <title>Late Work and Make-Up Policy</title>
		<p>
            Students are expected to complete all assignments on pace with the course. However, I 
            understand that external things get in the way. I will consider giving up to 1 week 
            extension on assignments when requested <em>before</em> the original due date of the 
            assignment. All assignments must be completed before the final exam, regardless of
            extension requests.
		</p>
        <p>
            If you must miss an exam, you must arrange a make up exam with me <em>before</em> the 
            day of the exam.
        </p>

        <title>Criteria</title>
        <p>
            Please read over all assignments and discussion prompts in advance and reach out if you
            have any questions or if you want to confirm you understand them correctly. Clarifying
            questions will help you avoid deductions in your grades.
