Students who have not done the following will be dropped according to PCC's No Show Policy :   Attend all of the first days of class up to the drop deadline.    Enroll in the ALEKS course and complete the first week's assignments.    Initialize your Google Sheets spreadsheet assignment using the template in D2L.   If you are unable to complete one of these requirements but want to remain enrolled in the class, you must speak to me to make an alternative arrangement to show engagement in the course.   "

Graded Assignments     Class Participation  Each day of class you will receive a grade based on arriving on time, having all of your required course materials and notes completed, engaging and participating during the lab time, and staying until the end of class.    ALEKS Homework  Most sections we cover in class will have an associated homework assignment in ALEKS. Additionally, there will be a knowledge check and a Module 1 check assigned.    Discussions  Each non-exam week will have a discussion prompt to respond to in D2L. Discussion prompts will be in two parts:   Create a new thread with your response to the prompt. Each prompt will have instructions for that week's post.    One or more replies to other students' posts. Each prompt will have instructions for that week's replies.       Book Applications  We will be completing worksheets in the textbook as a class, in groups, and on your own. There will be some time in class for this, but you will be expected to spend time out of class completing them if needed. Before each exam, I will collect your textbooks to grade your completeness.    Spreadsheet Assignments  As we progress through the class you will be assigned activities to complete with Google Sheets. There will be some time in class for this, but you will be expected to spend time out of class completing them if needed. I will grade your spreadsheet for completeness twice during the term.    Quizzes  Each non-exam week will have a quiz on the material we covered in class.    Exams  There will be three exams, each covering a different module from the textbook. The exams will be on February 4, February 25, and March 18.    Final Project  Starting in week 7, you will work with a group on a final project, planning out the purchase of a car. Your results will be presented on the last scheduled class day before the final exam.       Late Work and Make-Up Policy  Students are expected to complete all assignments on pace with the course. However, I understand that external things get in the way. I will consider giving up to 1 week extension on assignments when requested before the original due date of the assignment. All assignments must be completed before the final exam, regardless of extension requests.  If you must miss an exam, you must arrange a make up exam with me before the day of the exam.    Criteria  Please read over all assignments and discussion prompts in advance and reach out if you have any questions or if you want to confirm you understand them correctly. Clarifying questions will help you avoid deductions in your grades.
